## Introduction
Ultrasound segmentation of thyroid nodules is a challenging task, which plays an vital role in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. However, the following two factors limit the development of automatic thyroid nodule segmentation algorithms: (1) existing automatic nodule segmentation algorithms that directly apply semantic segmentation techniques can easily mistake non-thyroid areas as nodules, because of the lack of the thyroid gland region perception, the large number of similar areas in the ultrasonic images, and the inherently low contrast images; (2) the currently available dataset (i.e., DDTI) is small and collected from a single center, which violates the fact that thyroid ultrasound images are acquired from various devices in real-world situations. To overcome the lack of thyroid gland region prior knowledge, we design a thyroid region prior guided feature enhancement network (TRFE+) for accurate thyroid nodule segmentation. Specifically, (1) a novel multi-task learning framework that simultaneously learns the nodule size, gland position, and the nodule position is designed; (2) an adaptive gland region feature enhancement module is proposed to make full use of the thyroid gland prior knowledge; (3) a normalization approach with respect to the channel dimension is applied to alleviate the domain gap during the training process. To facilitate the development of thyroid nodule segmentation, we have contributed TN3K: an open-access dataset containing 3493 thyroid nodule images with high-quality nodule masks labeling from various devices and views. We perform a thorough evaluation based on the TN3K test set and DDTI to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
